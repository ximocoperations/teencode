    <h1>Introduction</h1>
   <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. 
      It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser),
       JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
   </p>
<ul>
    <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control
         a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an
          application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks,
           form input, and page navigation.</li>
    <li>
            Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant 
            to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions
             allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of
              information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file 
              manipulations on a server. 
    </li>
</ul>

</section class="main-section" id="What">
<h1>What you should already know</h1>
<p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).</li>
    <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
    <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section class="main-section" id="JavaScript_and_Java">
    <h1>JavaScript and Java</h1>
    <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally 
        different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but </p>
    <p>does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. 
        JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and </p>
    <p>basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
    <p>
            In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by 
            declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small 
    </p>
    <p>number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. 
        JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the </p>
        <p>more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides 
            dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary </p>
    <p>for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special 
        declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of </p>
        <p>objects, executing as loosely typed methods.</p>
<p>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do
     not have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not </p>
    <p>have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, 
        and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, </p>
<p>parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.</p>
</section>

<section class="main-section" id="Hello_world">
    <h1>Hello world</h1>
    <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and
         write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:</p>
    <div>
        <p>function greetMe(yourName) {</p>
              <p> alert("Hello " + yourName);</p>
             <p>}</p> 
             <p> greetMe("World");</p>
    </div>
    <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!</p>
    <section>
        <h1 id="Variables">
                Variables
        </h1>
        <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. 
            The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain </p>
            <p>rules.</p>
            <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_),
                 or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). </p>
         <p>Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase)
              and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>     
    <p>You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. 
        You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as </p>  
        <p>characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.</p>
